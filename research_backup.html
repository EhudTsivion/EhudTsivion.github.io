<h1>Can Noble-Gas Compounds Exist in Nature?</h1>
<h2>The HNgY nobel-gas compounds</h2>

    it is widely acknowledged, that preparation of compounds with noble-gas atoms
    is difficult, if not impossible. The main question of my research as a graduate
    student, revolved around the question of whether these compounds can exist in
    nature. We were particularly interested in a relatively new family of noble-gas
    containing compounds, the HNgY family, where H is hydrogen Ng is a noble-gas
    and Y is an electron-withdrawing group such as ·OH or ·CCH.
</p>
<p>
    There are (at least) two fascinating facts about the HNgY compounds:
    (1) They can be made from compounds that exist in nature such as water.
    The molecule <strong>HXeOH</strong> is made from the insertion of Xe into an
    H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. <strong>HXeCCH</strong> is made from the insertion for
    Xe to acetylene (2) The only known chemically bound compound of argon,
    <strong>HArF</strong>, belongs to this family.

<h2>
    Existence in Nature
</h2>
<p>
    There are good reasons to think that noble-gas compounds can exist in nature.
    Perhaps the most interesting indication, is what known as the "problem of
    the missing xenon" where xenon is found on earth, as well as on mars,
    in lower abundance than expected. A very plausible explanation, is that
    xenon is hidden in naturally occurring chemical compounds on earth. Second,
    the HNgY compound demonstrate, that xenon is capable of making compounds with
    water which is very abundant on earth's crust.

<h2>
    A Question of Kinetic Stability
</h2>
<p>
    All noble-gas compounds are meta-stable, that is, their lifetime is determined
    by the kinetic barriers for their decomposition.
