            My name is Ehud, but everyone calls me Udi.
        <p>
        <p>I grew up in a small Israeli town named <a id="GivatAda">"Givat Ada"</a> in an area that loosely resembles
            the Napa Vally, i.e., surrounded by hills and vineyards. My first scientific
            inquires involved burning of various house-hold materials in a series of experiments that yielded no
            interesting results but provided plenty of entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant portion of my adulthood of more than five years, had been devoted for military service
            and I was continuously been called to active reserve service, until I have left for the US.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently a post-doctocal scholar at UC Berkeley Chemsitry departmant and Maerial science devision
            at Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, working with
            <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/mhggrp/Head-Gordon_Home.html"

        </p>
        <p>
            Before that I've been a graduate student with <a href="https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/r-benny-gerber">
            Benny Gerber</a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working on the chemistry of the chemistry of
            noble-gas containing molecules of the H-Ng-Y family.
