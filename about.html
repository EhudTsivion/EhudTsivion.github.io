        My name is Ehud Tsivion or simply "Udi".
        I'm a computational scientist - I did my PhD
        in physical chemistry at the Hebrew University in
        Jerusalem and later worked as a postdoc at
        UC Berkeley.

        In the past, I've built physical models and used computers and algorithms
        to simulate physical processes such desorption of molecules from a surface
        or dissociation of weakly bound clusters.

        I'm passionate about problems
        that have impact on daily lives and have spent my recent years trying
        to figure out how to design hydrogen-gas adsorbing
        materials that would enable non-polluting vehicles.

        My favourite atom is xenon. It's really awesome.
