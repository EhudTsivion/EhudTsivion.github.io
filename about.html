<p>
    Hello, my name is Ehud, but everyone calls me Udi.
<p>
<p>I grew up in a small Israeli town named <a id="GivatAda">"Givat Ada"</a> in an area that loosely
    resembles the Napa Vally, i.e., surrounded by hills and vineyards. My first scientific
    inquires involved burning of various house-hold materials in a series of experiments that yielded no
    interesting results but provided plenty of entertainment. I'm married to Efrat, a social worker
    and a proud father of three.
</p>
<p>
    A significant portion of my adulthood of more than five years, had been devoted for military service
    and I was continuously been called to active reserve service, until I have left for the US.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently a post-doctocal scholar at UC Berkeley Chemsitry departmant and Maerial science devision
    at Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, working with
    <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/mhggrp/Head-Gordon_Home.html" id="martin">Martin Head-Gordon</a>
    on gas-adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks.
</p>
<p>
    Before that I've been a graduate student with <a href="https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/r-benny-gerber" id="benny">
    Benny Gerber</a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working on the chemistry of the chemistry of
    noble-gas containing molecules of the H-Ng-Y family.
</p>
<p>
    I'm interested in how molecules interact
</p>

<p>
    In my free time (?) I enjoy...
</p>

<p>
    Please have a look around this website and check out my scientific work as well as other cool things,
    like pictures of me and my family.
