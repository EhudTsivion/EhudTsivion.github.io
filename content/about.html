    My name is Ehud, but everyone calls me Udi.
<p>
<p>I grew up in a small Israeli town named <a id="GivatAda">"Givat Ada"</a> in an area that loosely
    resembles
    the Napa Vally, i.e., surrounded by hills and vineyards. My first scientific
    inquires involved burning of various house-hold materials in a series of experiments that yielded no
    interesting results but provided plenty of entertainment.
</p>
<p>
    A significant portion of my adulthood of more than five years, had been devoted for military service
    and I was continuously been called to active reserve service, until I have left for the US.

    I'm currently a post-doctocal scholar at UC Berkeley Chemsitry departmant and Maerial science devision
    at Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, working with
    <a href="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/mhggrp/Head-Gordon_Home.html"
       data-content="Matt has been a member since July 2014">
        Martin Head-Gordon</a>
    on gas-adsorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks.
</p>
<p>
    Before that I've been a graduate student with <a href="https://www.chem.uci.edu/people/r-benny-gerber">
    Benny Gerber</a> at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working on the chemistry of the chemistry of
    noble-gas containing molecules of the H-Ng-Y family.
