<h1 class="ui header">The HNgY noble-gas Compound</h1>

    it is widely acknowledged that preparation of compounds with noble-gas atoms
    is difficult, if not impossible. The main question of my research as a graduate
    student revolved around the question of whether such compounds can exist in
    nature, on earth or other planets. We were particularly interested in a relatively new family of noble-gas
    containing compounds, the HNgY family, where H is hydrogen, Ng is a noble-gas
    and Y is an electron-withdrawing group such as ·OH or ·CCH.

    There are (at least) two fascinating facts about the HNgY compounds:
    (1) They can be made from compounds that exist in nature such as water.
    The molecule <strong>HXeOH</strong> is made from the insertion of Xe into an
    H<sub>2</sub>O molecule and <strong>HXeCCH</strong> is made from the insertion for
    Xe to acetylene. (2) The only known chemically bound compound of argon,
    <strong>HArF</strong>, belongs to this family.

    Existence in Nature

    There is a good reason to think that noble-gas compounds can exist in nature.
    Perhaps the most interesting indication is the "problem of
    the missing xenon". In simple words, xenon is found on earths atmosphere
    (as well as on mars) in lower quantities than expected. A plausible
    explanation is that xenon is hidden in naturally occurring compounds on earth.

                How stable are the HNgY compounds?
            </h4>
            <div class="ui content">
                All noble-gas compounds are meta-stable, that is, their lifetime is determined
                by the kinetic barriers for their decomposition. Consequently, if the barrier for
                decomposition is high - they can remain stable even at high temperature.
                Surprisingly, we have found that HXeCCH is protected by high barriers of
                about −270 kJ/mol and is expected to survive for about a day at room temperature,
                before it decomposes.

                Stabilization by complex formation
            </h4>
            Another interesting thing that we've found, that formation of complexes can
            stablize the molecule. The simulation on the right shows a molecular dynamics
            simulation of of HXeCCH solvated in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. This droplet
            is stable at 150 K (at least). This is the fist prediction of a condensed
            phase of a noble-gas containing complex.
